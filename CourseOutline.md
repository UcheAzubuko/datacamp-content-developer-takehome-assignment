  * Learner will be able to create nested routes  
  * Learner will be able to use React Router hooks  
* **Exercise**: Set up routing for the Task Manager application. Create a `Home` page and an `About` page that provides details about the application. Add navigation links to switch between these pages.

### **Lesson 3.3: State Management beyond `useState`**

* **Learning objective**:   
  * Learner will be able to create a centralized state manager using Redux  
  * Learner will be able to manager server state using React Query
